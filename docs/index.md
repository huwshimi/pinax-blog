# pinax-blog

Originally named `biblion`, the eldarion.com blog app intended to be suitable
for site-level company and project blogs, is now known as `pinax-blog`.

!!! note "Pinax Ecosystem"
    This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app
    and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.

    To learn more about Pinax, see <http://pinaxproject.com/>


## Quickstart

Install the development version:

    pip install pinax-blog

Add `pinax-blog` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        "pinax.blog",
        # ...
    )

Add entry to your `urls.py`:

    url(r"^blog/", include("pinax.blog.urls"))

If you aren't using the Django Sites framework you will need to add `CURRENT_SITE` to your project `settings.py`:

    CURRENT_SITE = {
        "name": "My site",
        "domain": "example.com",
    }
